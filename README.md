Workflow:

To Do: New tasks or stories are added here.
In Progress: Tasks or stories being actively worked on.
Code Review: Code-related tasks await review.
Legal/Business Review: Tasks needing feedback or approval from Legal or Business teams.
Testing: Tasks or stories undergoing testing.
Done: Completed tasks or stories.
Additional Considerations:

Components: You can add components to categorize issues further, e.g., "Policy," "Models," "Monitoring."
Labels: Use labels to highlight specific aspects, e.g., "Disparate Impact," "LDA," "Tableau."
Priority: Set priorities to indicate the urgency of tasks or stories.
Assignee: Assign tasks or stories to relevant team members.
Due Dates: Set due dates to track progress and deadlines.
Example Workflow:

A new "Story" is created under the "Policy Implementation" epic: "Quantify Disparate Impact of Policy Change."
The story is assigned to you and moves to "In Progress."
You create "Tasks" under this story, e.g., "Code Implementation," "Data Cleaning & Preparation."
As you work on these tasks, they move through "Code Review," "Testing," and finally to "Done."
Once all tasks are complete, the "Story" is moved to "Legal/Business Review" for feedback.
After incorporating feedback, the "Story" is moved to "Done."
Remember:

Customize the JIRA board further to suit your team's specific needs and processes.
